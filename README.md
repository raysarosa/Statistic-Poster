Does Remote Work have an Impact in Mental Health?

The poster titled "Does Remote Work Have an Impact on Mental Health?" was developed as part of a postgraduate research project. The study aims to analyze the effects of remote work on mental health by examining various factors such as work interference, family history of mental illness, treatment status, and workplace support. The methodology includes data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of statistical tests like Chi-Square tests, t-Tests, and logistic regression analysis. The findings indicate that while remote work status alone does not significantly impact the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment, factors such as age, family history of mental health issues, and work interference play a substantial role. The study emphasizes the importance of workplace support systems and highlights the need for organizations to provide robust mental health resources. The poster showcases comprehensive statistical analysis and visualizations, making it a valuable contribution to postgraduate research in the field of mental health and remote work.
